For some projects, digitalRead() and digitalWrite() are too slow

port registers allow for low level reading and writing of ports

Ports: 
    B - Ditital pins 8 - 13
    C - Analog in pins
    D - Digital pins 0 - 7

3 registers per port:
    Digital {
        PORTD:
            DDRD: Port D Data Direction Register - read/write
            PORTD: Port D Data Register - read/write
            PIND: Port D Input Pins Register - read only
        PORTB
            DDRB: Port B Data Direction Register - read/write
            PORTB: Port B Data Register - read/write
            PINB: Port B Input Pins Register - read only
    }
    Analog {
        PORTC
            DDRC: Port C Data Direction Register - read/write
            PORTC: Port C Data Register - read/write
            PINC: Port C Input Pins Register - read only
    }

when reading or writing, each bit of the register corresponds to one pin
    Pin #    | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 |
    Register | 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 |
                      ^
             High and low values

to set read or write ports: 
    DDRD = B11111110;   // sets Arduino pins 1 to 7 as outputs, pin 0 as input
    DDRD = DDRD | B11111100;  // this is safer as it sets pins 2 to 7 as outputs
	                          // without changing the value of pins 0 & 1, which are RX & TX 

to check read or write ports simply call the register
    DDRD == B11111100

to set port values
    PORTD = B10101000; // sets digital pins 7,5,3 HIGH

to read the port values at once
    PIND == B10101000
